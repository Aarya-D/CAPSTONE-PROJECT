        <p id="poor"> "Poor" in turn is defined as "having insufficient wealth to meet the necessities or comforts of life or to live in a manner considered acceptable in a society."2 Central to these definitions are "needs," "comforts," and living "in a manner considered acceptable in a society." Taken together, they characterize poverty as an economic concept that refers to limited resources: being in poverty indicates a level of hardship or deprivation because resources are insufficient to meet a level of material well-being. </p>

                Poverty is an underlying cause of homelessness. The circumstances of poverty that can lead a person to become homeless include: having little money, debt, a lack of education, poor mental and physical health, disability, reliance on public housing, living in sub-standard accommodation and social exclusionvii.
                Homelessness and poverty are inextricably linked. People who are poor are frequently unable to pay for housing, food, child care, health care, and education. Difficult choices must be made when limited resources cover only some of these necessities.

                Prosperity causes poverty. ... The creation and accumulation of wealth by some individuals causes others to be poor, so runs the theory. Poverty is the consequence of an unequal distribution of income; the prosperity of some comes at the expense of others.Several factors are driving the increasing wealth gap. The most important appears to be the number of years of home ownership; at the 50th percentile, it accounts for roughly 28% of the observed racial wealth gap. The next most important factor is household income (explaining 17% of the gap).  Poverty, food insecurity, and poor nutrition have serious consequences for the health and well-being of children, adults, and older adults, including a greater risk for chronic disease and poor mental health.           </div>           </li>

                Without an education, many are left jobless and stuck living in poverty for the rest of their lives, that degrades our level and a good student gets off the mark. ... These students will continue to be behind. The low-income children are many a times more likely to drop out when they reach high school.The root cause of poverty is lack of education. If you can't read or do basic math, if you can't show up for work and apply yourself, you will not have a job. You will be poor. ... Good teaching is hard work; teaching children mired in poverty is even harder.              </div>

    <h1 id="world">WORLD'S 5 POOREST COUNTRIES</h1>
    <caption>At Concern, we go where we are needed most in our fight against extreme poverty. But where is that, exactly? And which countries need the most assistance? </caption>

    <ul>
    <li>1.NIGER</li>
    <p id="para">A combination of a GNI per capita of $906, life expectancy of 60.4 years, and a mean 2 years of schooling (against an expected 5.4) lead to Niger once again topping the UN‚Äôs human development report as the world‚Äôs poorest country. World Bank data from 2014 estimate 44.5% of the country‚Äôs population of 21.5 million living in extreme poverty. </p>
    <br>

    <li>CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC</li>
    <br>
    <p id="para">Unsurprisingly, the world‚Äôs hungriest country is also one of the poorest. In the 2019 Global Hunger Index (GHI), the Central African Republic was the only country with hunger levels classified as ‚Äúextremely alarming.‚Äù The connection between hunger and poverty is apparent here: 2008 estimates from the World Bank suggest 62% of Central Africans are living at or below the poverty line, with the UN indicating a life expectancy of just 52.8 years. The country‚Äôs GN</p>

    <li>CHAD</li>
    <p id="para">Despite a $4 billion pipeline that links the country‚Äôs oil fields to coastline terminals, Chad is one of the world‚Äôs poorest countries thanks to poor infrastructure and conflict (most notably from the militant group Boko Haram). Ongoing conflict and the effects of climate change mean that nearly 48% of Chadians live in a state of economic vulnerability (per World Bank data from 2011). The country‚Äôs per capita income is $1,716 and its average life expectancy is 54 years. Most children receive just over two years of schooling (compared to the expected 7.5 years). 

      Concern has worked in Chad for 12 years, and in the last 3 years we‚Äôve stepped up our efforts in an already-precarious country following added aggravation that has left 4.7 million people in need of humanitarian assistance. We are responding to the humanitarian needs of displaced populations in the Lake Chad area, implementing health and nutrition programs to deliver life-saving assistance. Our work in the Sila region of eastern Chad focuses on building community resilience to counter potential disasters. </p>

    <li>SOUTH SUDAN</li>
    <p id="para">The Republic of South Sudan gained independence in July 2011, but has experienced a long history of conflict, displacement, and deepening humanitarian needs. As of 2016, the World Bank estimates over 82% of the South Sudanese population are living in extreme poverty. While mean years of schooling are comparable to expected years (4.8 and 5 years, respectively), life expectancy is just 57 years old, and GNI per capita is $1,455. Widespread displacement puts undue pressure on people‚Äôs ability to cope, with over 2.3 million South Sudanese refugees living abroad and another 1.74 million internally displaced.</p>
    <img src="https://www.concernusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/John-Demng-with-kids-1180x787.jpg" alt="">
    <li>BURUNDI</li>
    <p id="para">The Republic of Burundi has been in conflict consistently since gaining independence from Belgium in 1962, culminating in a 1994 civil war. Unlike many other countries on this list, its GNI per capita has dropped in 2019 compared to 2018 ‚Äî from $702 to $660 (although life expectancy has gone up by nearly 5 years). Most children only complete 3 years of schooling, against an expected education of 11 years. With 740 deaths per 100,000 live births, the country is one of the most dangerous places in the world to have a child. </p>
